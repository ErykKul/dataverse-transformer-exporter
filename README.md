# Transformer Exporter for Dataverse

This exporter allows you to have up to 100 exporters using a single pre-built JAR file. You can add new exporters by adding directories into the exporters directory (see the Installation section below) and placing (and editing) the `config.json` and the `transformation.json` files in it. Supported Dataverse versions: 6.0 - recent. As for now, only the JSON transformations are supporterd. Future release of this exporter (comming soon!) will also support the XSLT transformations (with at least two files `config.xml` and `transformer.xsl` in the configuration directory of the exporters directory).

## Installation

If you havenâ€™t already configured it, set the [dataverse-spi-exporters-directory](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/config.html#dataverse-spi-exporters-directory) configuration value first. Then navigate to the configured directory and download the [JAR file](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/github/erykkul/dataverse-transformer-exporter/1.0.1/dataverse-transformer-exporter-1.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar) together with the examples you want to try out:

```shell
# download the jar
wget -O transformer-exporter-1.0.1.jar https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/github/erykkul/dataverse-transformer-exporter/1.0.1/dataverse-transformer-exporter-1.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar

wget -O generated-with-python/transformer.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erykkul/dataverse-transformer-exporter/main/examples/generated-with-python/transformer.json
```

After restarting the Dataverse, you should be able to use the newly installed exporters (next to the internal exporters):

Each exporter will have at least these files after starting:

All of these files can be edited, if needed. Typically you will only need to edit the `config.json` and the `transformation.json` files. If you want to add more exporters, your own or from the provided examples, just add a new configuration directory in your exporters directory with at least the `config.json` and `transformer.json` files there. After restarting the servers the newly added exporters should be ready to use.

## Examples

The following examples are provided in the [examples](/examples/) directory:

### Hello World!

Very basic exporter providing always the same output: `{"hello":"World!"}`.

### Debug

This exporter uses only the identity transformation on the provided source document. It lets you to see what fields are available for copying and transforming:
- `datasetJson`: native Dataverse JSON export
- `datasetORE`: ORE Dataverse export
- `datasetSchemaDotOrg`: Schema.org JSON-LD export
- `datasetFileDetails`: file details from the native Dataverse JSON export
- `preTransformed`: JSON-pointer friendly version of the native Dataverse JSON export
- `config`: the content of the `config.json`

### Short example

This exporter copies only the title, the author names and the file download URL to the output.

### Javascript transformer

The same exporter as the "Short example", but it uses JavaScript instead of copy transformations.

### Croissant

This exporter is entirely based on the [Croissant Exporter for Dataverse](https://github.com/gdcc/exporter-croissant). It is simply a port of that exporter into JavaScript that is bundled into a ready to use transformer. It is also a great example to start from when writing your own exporters.

### Basic RO-Crate

This exporter transforms the output from the Schema.org exporter into an RO-Crate compatible output.

### Transformer generated with Python

This exporter is based on the [Customizable RO-Crate Metadata Exporter for Dataverse](https://github.com/gdcc/exporter-ro-crate). You can edit the provided [CSV file](/examples/generated-with-python/dataverse2ro-crate.csv) and rerun the Python script to overwrite the default `transformer.json`:

```shell
python3 csv2transformer.py
```

After copying the resulting `transformer.json`, together with the provided `config.jar`, you will have a customized RO-Crate exporter (listed as "CSV RO-Crate" by default).

## Developer guide

The easiest way to start is to write JavasCript code. You can use the provided [Croissant](/examples/croissant/js/croissant.js) code as the start point. You will need to restart the server after changing that code. Note that the exporters use caching, you will need to either to wait until the cache is expired or delete the cached exporter output manually to see the changes.

The JavaScript supported by the transformer exporter is as provided by the [Project Nashorn](https://openjdk.org/projects/nashorn/), you can only use the syntax provided by that project. Additional limitation is that the multiple line statements are not supported. This could be circumvented by using a minimizer, or simply by using only single line statements (empty lines, comments, etc. are fine to include in the JavaScript files). Finally, you can access these Java classes from your scripts:
- `Map`: `java.util.LinkedHashMap`
- `Set`: `java.util.LinkedHashSet`
- `List`: `java.util.ArrayList`
- `Collectors`: `java.util.stream.Collectors`
- `JsonValue`: `jakarta.json.JsonValue`

You can also try writing the transformations using the transformation language as described [here](https://github.com/ErykKul/json-transformer). It is a preferred way for writing straight-forward exporters, for example, when you only need to add one or more fields to an already existing exporter format. In that case, you could use the identity transformation followed by simple copy transformations. You can also start from an already existing example and add new copy, remove, etc., transformations at the end of the `transformer.json` file.
